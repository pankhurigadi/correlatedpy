Welcome to `correlatedpy <https://github.com/oboufous/correlatedpy>`_'s documentation!
====================================================================================

This is a Python library used for learning of a correlated equilibrium in multiplayer strategic form games.

The algorithm allows players in a multiagent system to reach an equilibrium in a distributed fashion. 

The purpose of this documentation is to provide:

1. a :ref:`quick start guide <quickstart>` describing the environment and the customization options;
2. a :ref:`detailed description <user_guide>` of the nuts and bolts of the project, and how *you* can contribute.
